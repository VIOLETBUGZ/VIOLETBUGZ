<p align="center"> 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 i have adhd and very bad anxiety so please be patient with me if i seem shy or nervous or if i dont reply to a msg/ping for a while. i struggle with holding conversations, and i also tend to get super attached easily but i try not to be annoying about it. dont friend me just to not talk to me again.

<p align="center"> 𝗱𝗼 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 if you're below 15 or above 21, or are a proshipper or apart of any sort of basic dni criteria. i do not have a very specific dni list other than that but i block freely. i hate __all mafioso ships__ and ichance. if u ship those, you can still interact, just dont talk about them around me.

## <p align="center"> **ponytown specific**

<p align="center"> c+h is heavily encouraged if i have it in my display name ^_^ if its not or if im with a friend, interacting is fine, but i prefer if people keep their distance a little. if you're a friend and you see me interacting with someone, approaching me is completely okay + encouraged.


<p align="center"> i get anxious and sometimes overwhelmed in crowded spaces and may need to take a step back to calm down.
