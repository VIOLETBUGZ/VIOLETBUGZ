hi!! im **violet,** but i also go by **shelly, till, protag, rui, or literally whatever my current pony is.** i'm a trans male and use **they/them pronouns and exclusively masc terms,** and i'm seventeen (turning eighteen in september)

i like ***alien stage, project sekai, dandys world, racheldrawsthis' games,** pokemon, our life, a date with death,* forsaken, pressure, rain world, and many more that im too lazy to list ^_^ my interests also tend to change often (usually every 2 months) so expect a change every now and again

im an artist, yumeshipper, shiny hunter, and sometimes a writer ^^ i like drawing on peoples strawpages (i always leave a pink heart in the corner :3)

**before you interact,** i have adhd and very bad anxiety so please be patient with me if i seem shy or nervous or if i dont reply to a msg/ping for a while !! i struggle with holding conversations ,,, i also tend to get super attached easily but i try not to be annoying about it 3:

**do not interact** if you're below 15 or above 21, or are a proshipper or apart of any sort of basic dni criteria. i do not have a very specific dni list other than that but i block freely. ivanluka/lukatill shippers dni too i hate those ships so bad /srs

**ponytown specific**

c+h is heavily encouraged if i have it in my display name! if its not or if im with a friend, interacting is fine, but i prefer if people keep their distance a little ^_^

i get anxious in crowded spaces often so ðŸ˜“ err

*if my status is **online:*** i'm active. duh
*if my status is **idle:*** i'm offtab or afk
*if my status is **busy:*** i'm doing something and can't tab in often, or i don't want to be bothered
