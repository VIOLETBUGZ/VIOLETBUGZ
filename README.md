## <p align="center"> my name is violet, phoenix, bug, rainbeau, or really whatever you wanna call me. nicknames are ok idgaf

<p align="center"> i mainly like dispatch, phighting, project sekai, and dandys world, but i also like silksong, the amazing digital circus racheldrawsthis' games, beastars, pokemon, our life, a date with death, pressure, rain world, and many more that im too lazy to list. ^_^ my interests also tend to change often (usually every 2 months) so expect a change every now and again.

<p align="center"> 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 i'm 18, i have very very VERY bad social anxiety, so i get really nervous when trying to interact with people/make friends — if i dont approach you or speak to you, i dont hate you, i just get nervous. i struggle with holding conversations and responding to stuff if we're not close, and i dont have alot of friends so i also tend to get really jealous and super attached easily but i try not to be annoying about it. i am very very sensitive and can get really emotionally unstable sometimes so pls be kind .... also dont make "im gonna touch you" jokes about me and dont flirt with me.

<p align="center"> 𝗱𝗼 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 if you're below 15 or above 21, are apart of any sort of basic dni criteria, or make "clanker" jokes you guys are unfunny. i do not have a very specific dni list other than that but i block freely. i do not like any zuka ships, or vinehammer/scythestaff. if u ship those, you can still interact, just dont talk about them around me. strictly dni if you romantically ship medsword/subgraft
