hi!! im **violet,** but i also go by **whatever my current pony is.** i'm a trans male and use **they/them pronouns and exclusively masc terms,** and i'm seventeen (turning eighteen in september)

i like ***forsaken, project sekai,*** **dandys world,** *racheldrawsthis' games,* beastars, pokemon, our life, a date with death, pressure, rain world, and many more that im too lazy to list ^_^ my interests also tend to change often (usually every 2 months) so expect a change every now and again

ship wise i'm obsessed with **paycheck, pizzapunch, toughluck, pizzaburger,** and **azuretime**

im an artist, yumeshipper, shiny hunter, and sometimes a writer ^^ i like drawing on peoples strawpages (i always leave a pink heart in the corner :3)

**before you interact,** i have adhd and very bad anxiety so please be patient with me if i seem shy or nervous or if i dont reply to a msg/ping for a while !! i struggle with holding conversations ,,, i also tend to get super attached easily but i try not to be annoying about it 3: **dont friend me just to not talk to me again**

**do not interact** if you're below 15 or above 21, or are a proshipper or apart of any sort of basic dni criteria. i do not have a very specific dni list other than that but i block freely. **i hate __all mafioso ships__ and ichance if u ship those DNI im so srs**
